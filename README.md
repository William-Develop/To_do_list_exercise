# To-do list excercise
This is a simple to-do list program that allows the user to add, complete and view tasks. The program uses a while loop to keep running until the user quits. The user can type in a task to add it to the list, or type in a number to mark it as completed. The program also has a help option that displays the available commands. The program prints out the completed tasks and the number of tasks completed at the end.

## Prerequisites
To run the program, you need to have Python installed on your computer.

## Usage
You can execute the program by typing python `main.py` in your terminal.
